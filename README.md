This is an application for the fictional Assetto Corsa series World Grand Prix, inspired by the racing series from the movie Cars 2. In this competition, major oil companies have come together to showcase a new carbon-neutral fuel on a global stage. The fuel will be used in cars based on the legendary Ferrari F2002 platformâ€”one of the most dominant Formula 1 cars in history. Driven by Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello during the 2002 and early 2003 seasons, the F2002 achieved remarkable success, setting new benchmarks in the sport.
