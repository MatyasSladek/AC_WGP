# Project Direction

The original idea behind this project was to build a companion app for **Assetto Corsa** where players could upload race results after each event and manage progression between seasons.
That implementation is available in the `main` branch.

While using the app during my first season of a World Grand Prix championship, I discovered something that manually uploading results after every race quickly became tedious. At the same time, the core championship flow—moving from race to race and tracking standings—is already handled very well inside the game itself.

Because of that, I decided to shift the focus of the project.

# New Focus (refactoring branch)

Instead of duplicating features that already exist in Assetto Corsa, the new version of the app concentrates on areas:

- working directly with game files,

- automating championship creation,

- improving and evolving car statistics,

- expanding what happens between seasons.

The goal is to make the off-season feel meaningful. Rather than just clicking a button to generate a new year, the app aims to simulate the atmosphere of the paddock during winter break—rule changes, development, team decisions, and other behind-the-scenes elements that let the player imagine what might be happening before the next green flag.

In short, the app becomes less of a race-day companion and more of a management and immersion tool that extends the world around the championship.
